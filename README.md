### Summary
Welcome to my implementation of chip 8 in rust and web assembly!

### Some reference pages for easy access to chip8:
- [Instruction Set Reference](https://github.com/mattmikolay/chip-8/wiki/CHIP%E2%80%908-Instruction-Set)

### Notes on instruction format
- Roms are ordered big endian format
- need to convert to little endian when parsing
